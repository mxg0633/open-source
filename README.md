COMP 312
Homework 2 Data Challenge

Data Sets used from Chicago Data Portal:

1. 311_Service_Requests_-_Graffiti_Removal.csv
2. Performance_Metrics_-_Streets___Sanitation_-_Graffiti_Removal.csv
3. Graffiti_test (A subset of #1 because it was too large of a file to upload to github. Will split and upload)

My goals are to find:
1. If there are different est. times of removal depending if the area is residential or commercial.
2. The average "life time" of a graffiti painting (street art).
3. If there is a relationship between neighborhoods and requests for graffiti removal.
4. Property value vs. graffiti removal requests.

Python Output:

The average # of Graffiti Removal Requests from 2015 per Zipcode is:
